          Granada’s Traditional Architecture and Its Role in Cooling the City
        </h2>
        <p>
          Granada’s historical architecture, strongly influenced by Moorish
          design principles, has long incorporated strategies to mitigate
          excessive heat. Many traditional buildings feature whitewashed
          exteriors, a technique that reflects rather than absorbs solar
          radiation. Additionally, the presence of interior courtyards, or
          patios, is a defining feature of Granada’s older homes. These
          courtyards, often filled with vegetation and water features, create
          cool microclimates, improving thermal regulation by promoting
          evaporative cooling and providing much-needed shaded areas. These
          design strategies ensure that despite high summer temperatures,
          traditional urban spaces remain livable and comfortable, a stark
          contrast to the heat retention seen in modern developments.

        <h2>Understanding Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Its Causes</h2>
        <p>
          Urban areas tend to experience significantly higher temperatures than
          their rural surroundings due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.
          One way to assess this effect is through Land Surface Temperature
          (LST) data. The intensity of UHI is influenced by several factors,
          including the reduction of vegetation, which eliminates natural
          cooling through shade and evaporation, and the widespread use of dark,
          dense building materials that trap heat. The layout of urban areas
          also plays a role, as do human activities such as vehicle emissions,
          industrial operations, and extensive air conditioning use contribute
          to higher overall heat accumulation. Addressing UHI is particularly
          important for ensuring human comfort and sustainable urban living.

        <p>
          This spatial analysis is based on Landsat 8 Band 10 (thermal infrared)
          data from July 2022, filtered for images with less than 10% cloud
          cover, to identify urban heat hotspots in Granada.The neighborhood
          boundaries used in this analysis are rough estimates and may not align
          perfectly with official administrative divisions. The findings should
          be interpreted as general trends rather than precise localized
          measurements.
